# Welcome to my ePortfolio

Here is a list of works showing my most exemplary software engineering examples during my academic career in Computer Science

Additionally, I have completed a series of enhancements above and beyond what was required for the original course, in order to showcase my abilities further in several key areas.

## Code Review

Here is a link to my video code review where I go through these projects, in the video I identify the need to make the following enhancements:
- Algorithms and Data Structures: expand upon the stock report returned, making it more complex and more professional in appearance
- Databases: Make the database more secure by adding a username/password requirement to access the DB
- Software Engineering: Convert the project from Python into Java which will relay a variety of software development skills

## Enhancement One - Databases
Here we will make the first enhancement which involves adding the username and password to the database.
First, here is the original code setting up the databse connection:
```

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/TeritoDanny/Capstone/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
